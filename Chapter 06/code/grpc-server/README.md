This repo contains a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) application with a gRPC server in Go, with a basic code organization.
We use:
* net/http package to retrieve our cute Gophers
* Cobra for creating powerful modern CLI applications
* Viper to ...
* ...

go-gopher-grpc use [Taskfile](https://dev.to/stack-labs/introduction-to-taskfile-a-makefile-alternative-h92) (a Makefile alternative).
